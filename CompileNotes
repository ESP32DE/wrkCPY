To compile devFlowcharter you will need:
 - Delphi 7 (any edition)
 - stuff from ThirdParty\ThirdParty.zip: unpack FastCode, FastMM4, OmniXML, Synedit directories and add to library paths in Delphi (Tools->Environment Options->Library->Library path)

If interested to add support for new programming language check LangTemplates\Pascal_Template.pas.
